This is the equation to find the area of a triangle: \[ A = 1/2 * b * h \]

```{r task_six}
library(rmarkdown)
100 / 10 + 2
100 / (10 + 2)
print("The second equation has parentheses.")

100 + 100 * (3 + 4) / 2
(100 + 100) * 3 + 4 / 2 * (5 - 7) + 20
100 + 500 * 3 + 4 - 2

```{r task_seven}

```{r task_eight}
one_to_thirty <-seq(from = 1, to = 30)
people <- c("Asuna","Kirito","Yuki","Leefa")

length(people)

```

```{r task_nine}

six_to_ten <- seq

sum_seq <- one_to_five + six_to_ten
sum_seq

product_seq <- one_to_five * six_to_ten
```

```{r task_ten}
combined_seq <- c(one_to_five, six_to_ten)

matrix_seq <- rbind(one_to_five, six_to_ten, product_seq)
matrix_seq

matrix_df <- as.data.frame(matrix_seq)
matrix_df
```

## Loading the Data 
This is how to load data into R and how to convert it

```{r task_12_to_14, echo=TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
file_name <- read.csv("China_EO_49to17.csv")
china_data <- as_tibble(file_name)
china_data <- arrange(china_data, desc(Year))

shanghai_and_beijing <- china_data %>% 
                        filter(Year >= 2000) %>% 
                        select(Year,
                               Beijing_Enterprise,
                               Beijing_Output,
                               Shanghai_Enterprise,
                               Shanghai_Output)
shanghai_and_beijing

shanghai_and_beijing_data <- shanghai_and_beijing %>%
                              mutate(Output_Ratio = Beijing_Output/Shanghai_Output)

shanghai_and_beijing_data
```
